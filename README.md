## Usage

### Indexing Files

To index files in a directory, simply run the following command:

```bash
FastSearch index /path/to/directory
```

This will scan the directory and create an index of all files, storing their names and paths in memory. The index will significantly speed up subsequent searches.

FastSearch also allows you to index your entire system! **Please note:** This operation can require substantial disk space and may take a considerable amount of time, especially with a large number of files.

### Searching for Files

To search for a specific file, use the following command:

```bash
FastSearch search "filename"
```

You can search for complete or partial file names, and FastSearch will return all matching results.

### Searching in Files

To search for a string within one or multiple files, use the following command:

```bash
FastSearch find "yoursearch" <directory (empty for every directory you indexed)>
```

This will search for the specified string within the indexed files.

## Advanced Features

- **Multi-threaded Indexing**: FastSearch can index multiple files concurrently, speeding up the indexing process, especially for large datasets.
- **Result Caching**: The index can be saved to disk, so if the program is closed and reopened, future searches are faster by skipping re-indexing.
